<h1 align="center">Bowling Game</h1>

"Bowling Game" is a final exam project from the "Games Computing" course at Singidunum University. The course was designed to teach students about game development and the use of game engines. During the course, students used the Unity Game Engine to develop various mini-games.

The final exam project required that students create a bowling game using the Unity Game Engine. It had to allow multiple players to play and keep track of their scores. Alongside the game, students had to create a user interface that would allow players to input their names and change game settings to increase or decrease the difficulty.
